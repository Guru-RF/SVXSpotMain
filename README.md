## Repository Overview

This repository tracks the **main branch** of SVXLink. Most features are identical to the stable branch, with some notable new additions:

- **Encryption** for enhanced security.
- **Passwordless authentication** for ease of use.  

After running the configurator, your **SVXReflector sysop** will need to sign your certificate. Once that's done, you're all set!
